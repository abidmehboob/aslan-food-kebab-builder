## Development Notes

### **Architecture Decisions**
- **MVC Pattern**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Middleware Stack**: Security, logging, validation
- **Error-First Callbacks**: Consistent error handling
- **Environment Configuration**: 12-factor app principles

### **Security Considerations**
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- Passwords are hashed with configurable rounds
- JWT tokens have configurable expiration
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Security headers protect against common attacks

### **Performance Optimizations**
- Frontend assets are minified in production
- Database queries use appropriate indexes
- Response compression reduces bandwidth
- Static files are served with caching headers
- Process clustering maximizes CPU utilization

### **Future Roadmap**
- Real-time order tracking with WebSockets
- Payment gateway integration
- Admin dashboard for order management
- Mobile app with push notifications
- Analytics and reporting features
